# Deep Soccer using Deepstream-5.1

In recent years, the amount of data available in football has increased with sensors, GPS trackers, and computer vision algorithms to track how players move and how the ball moves. Despite this, machine learning and AI have only come into use to derive insights and make decisions in sports. And moreover, in football, the penalty kick is a very hotly anticipated position that no one knows beforehand how it will end up. Here comes to picture of Deep Soccer Project. Deep Soccer detects the football during the match and penalty shot time for calculating the number of the goals shooted by the team. This app, built on Nvidia's Deepsteam SDK, would also help during different kinds of sports video analytics.

## Introduction

An Intelligent Video Analytics Pipeline powered by Deepstream and NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

This project is a proof-of-concept, trying to detect is person inside the restricted area.

## Deepstream Setup

This post assumes you have a fully functional Jetson device. If not, you can refer the documentation [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/install-jetpack/index.html).

### 1. Install System Dependencies

```sh
sudo apt install \
libssl1.0.0 \
libgstreamer1.0-0 \
gstreamer1.0-tools \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
gstreamer1.0-libav \
libgstrtspserver-1.0-0 \
libjansson4=2.11-1
```

### 2. Install Deepstream

Download the DeepStream 5.1 Jetson Debian package `deepstream-5.1_5.1.0-1_arm64.deb`, to the Jetson device from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-getting-started). Then enter the command:

```sh
sudo apt install deepstream-5.1_5.1.0-1_arm64.deb
```

For more information, go to the get started page of Deepstream [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html).

## Running the Application

### 1. Clone the repository

This is a straightforward step, however, if you are new to git, I recommend glancing threw the steps.

First, install git

```sh
sudo apt install git
```

Next, clone the repository

```sh
# Using HTTPS
https://github.com/Nivitus/Deep_Soccer.git 
# Using SSH
git@github.com:Nivitus/Deep_Soccer.git
```

### 2. Download the weights file

Download the weights file from [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3jXbSyJvY9Hpw4Wq7fXnj3KwEwTPhm8/view?usp=sharing) and place it in `models/YOLOv4` directory.

### 3. Build the application

First, build the application by running the following command:

```sh
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

This will generate the binary called `deep_soccer`. This is a one-time step and you need to do this only when you make source-code changes.

### 4. Run with different input sources

Next, create a file called `inputsources.txt` and paste the path of videos.

```sh
file:///home/nivitus/Music/Deep_Soccer/balls.mp4
file:///home/nivitus/Music/Deep_Soccer/ball.mp4
```

Now, run the application by running the following command:

```sh
./deep_soccer
```
